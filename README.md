[Seam](https://www.seam.so) is a community-developed platform to code, design, and curate your perfect social spaces. You can make new cards filled with anything from around the internet, from profiles for yourself or moodboards for your favorite things. Then you can publish your card as a website to share it with your friends.

Many people ask how to make cool blocks like the ones that already live inside the Seam editor. The answer is React components. It is simple to learn and anyone can do it. You don't need to already be a programmer, and you can use the examples of other blocks that already exist to get started.

We've made it easy in this repository to make a new block, and then publish it live so that anyone else in the world can use your new creation, too. We're all building this together!

ðŸš§ Note: The Seam platform is under constant development, and occasionally the block builder might lag behind the functionality on the Seam platform. If there currently isn't a way to build what you're dreaming up, feel free to file a github issue as a feature request.

### What are blocks?

Blocks are software Legos; they are small, re-usable components and functionality. Each profile is made of blocks. Use the music block to play your anthem, the video block to showcase your projects, the text block to write anything you want. And if you need something that isn't already available, you can make it here, yourself. 

**What happens when you make a block on Seam?**
- Accepted blocks go inside [seam.so](https://www.seam.so), and then you can add them into your profile!
- Anyone else can also use your block on their profile.
  - Eventually, you'll be able to earn points + rewards when your block goes viral after being added to many different profiles.
- You'll learn to code Javascript and React, one of the most used languages on the Internet.

# Start Here

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7350670/213023742-116abf08-51d8-4b9e-a289-7b601b5d458a.mp4

1. git clone the repo, `cd Block-SDK`
2. `yarn install`
3. `./seam-magic.sh` will guide you through creating a template of an empty block, given whatever name you choose! If this doesn't work for you (Windows users), see below for instructions on how to set up the SDK manually.
4. `yarn start` to see your new block in action.

# Setting up the SDK Manually

Under the folder `src/blocks/blockIcons`, add a picture for your block icon, which will be displayed to users. Then, import it into `src/blocks/types.tsx`. It should look like this:
```
import marqueeIcon from "./blockIcons/marqueeIcon.png"
```

Then, add your block to the types dictionary. It should be in the following format, where ***shortName***, ***name***, and ***description*** are strings of your choosing. ***icon*** is the icon you just imported.
```
shortName: { 
        type: shortName,
        displayName: name,
        displayDescription: description,
        emptyTitle: "Empty name Block",
        emptySubtitle: "Tap here to setup your name block!",
        icon: icon, // TODO: insert your block icon here
        deprecated: false,
        feedConstrained: false,
        doesBlockPost: false
    }
```
 ***shortName*** is the name of your block without spaces. For consistency purposes, it's recommended that this is capitalized. ***name*** is the name of the block, visible to users. ***description*** tells users what your block does.

For example, here's the Marquee block type:
```
  "Marquee": {
    type: "Marquee",
    displayName: "Marquee",
    displayDescription: "Displays a scrolling banner of text",
    emptyTitle: "Empty Marquee Block",
    emptySubtitle: "Tap here to setup your Marquee block!",
    icon: marqueeIcon,
    deprecated: false,
    feedConstrained: false,
    doesBlockPost: true
  }
```

Next, create a ***shortName***Block.tsx file for your block under `src/blocks`. Copy and paste the contents of `src/blocks/BlockTemplate.txt` into ***shortName***Block.tsx. Inside the ***shortName***Block.tsx file, replace %NAME% with ***shortName***. Note that when naming the file and replacing %NAME%, ***shortName*** should be capitalized, if it isn't already.

For example, here is what the `src/blocks/MarqueBlock.tsx` file would contain after this step:
```
import Block from './Block'
import { BlockModel } from './types'
import BlockFactory from './BlockFactory';
import './BlockStyles.css'

export default class MarqueeBlock extends Block {
  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Marquee Block!</h1>
    );
  }

  renderEditModal(done: (data: BlockModel) => void) {
    return (
      <h1>Edit Marquee Block!</h1>
    )
  }

  renderErrorState() {
    return (
      <h1>Error!</h1>
    )
  }
}
```

Afterwards, import your block into `src/blocks/BlockFactory.tsx` like this:
```
import MarqueeBlock from './MarqueeBlock'
```
And add a case for your block to the switch, like so:
```
case "Marquee": return new MarqueeBlock(model, theme)
```
Note that the string after `case` should be ***shortName***.

Then, in `src/App.tsx`, replace %NAME% with ***shortName***:
```
  let yourBlock: BlockModel = {
    type: "Marquee",
    data: {},
    uuid: "test"
  }
```
# Block Maker's Guide

After creating your new block using our magic script, there are only 3 functions you need to write to make your block.
- The `render()` function renders the block based on the data it has in its `BlockModel`.
- The `renderEditModal` function renders what goes inside the edit modal, which is typically a form for the user to add their customization options into. It also has a `done` function, which will call with the finished model.
- The `renderErrorState` function, which is shown whenever there is an error.

### Icons

Lastly, don't forget to add your **icon** to `types.tsx`! This is the icon that will show when the user is browsing the block list inside the Seam editor.

The best way to find an icon is to use [Google's icons here](https://fonts.google.com/icons), search for the one you want, and download it as a PNG. Then add it to the `blockIcons` folder.

### Saving and Accessing data

Each block is given a `BlockModel` from our server, which holds a key/value store inside of its `data`. Here, you can store any string you want -- each block holds data for the card that it lives in, meaning that you don't have to worry about different users/cards when storing data.

When the block is added to a card in production, it hooks into a fully functioning data layer using the same api that was previously mocked for your local development.

### Design Systems

With Seam blocks, you don't have to start from scratch. Learn from examples of existing blocks, and in addition, we use the [Material UI system (MUI)](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/). Browse the docs to use common components like buttons, selectors, and more. We are in the process of deprecating the `antd` library.

### Theming

As the block developer, you decide how you want your block to reflect the global card theme. Each Seam card has a theme, which determines background color, block background color, font, and many other attributes. Themes are implemented as [`MUI Themes`](https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/theming/), which provides handy defaults and color palettes for theming components.

To use the theme, you can find it in your block at `this.theme`. The key variables you might want are as follows:

```
palette: {
    primary: {          // Card Background
      main: "#020303"
    },
    secondary: {
      main: "#1C1C1C"  // Block Background
    },
    info: {
      main: "#CCFE07"  // Accent Color
    }
  },
  typography: {
    fontFamily: "monospace"
  }
```

You can find working examples inside of the `LinkBlock.tsx` and the default theme in `App.tsx`. It is entirely optional to use the themes in your block, but it can add greater cohesion and make your block fit nicer inside of user's cards. If you don't use the theme variables, your block will have a white background by default, and it is up to you to define a font.

# Block Submission
Once you are happy with your block, it's time to create a pull request so your block can go live on the [seam.so](www.seam.so) site!

### Before you Submit

To help your pull request go as smoothly as possible, review the steps listed below that can slow down a review. Make sure you:
- Test your block for crashes and bugs
- Remove all `console.log` statements, commented code, and unused code. Remember, your block will live open source as an example for new developers who come behind you!
- Make a Seam profile so that we know who to credit
- Don't include any large new dependencies that would slow down the entire Seam loading experience

### Making the Submission

For easiest review, please format the title of your pull request like so:
- Title: [Block Submission]: Title of block

Then in the body, make sure to have these sections:
- Photos! We want to see your block in action.
- Author: Seam username, Twitter handle if you have one so we can include you in our block release tweets 
- Seam card: What's your Seam profile card? This is how we can credit you!
- Summary: What does your block do?
- Remixes: Did you remix or copy code from another block? Which ones?

We'll accept any blocks that are genuine and fun and come from your own imagination. We strongly support all points of view being represented on Seam, as long as the blocks are respectful to users with differing opinions and the quality of the block is great. We won't merge any blocks for any content or behavior that we believe is over the line.

# Q&A
- My block needs a dependency. How should I include it?
    - Add your new package using `yarn add`, and the main Seam application will bundle it when your block is accepted. Please don't add any extra UI libraries, as those can be very large, slowing down the entire Seam site.
- My block needs an external API key. How do I make it work?
    - The unfortunate reality of our current walled garden internet is that much of it is gated behind API keys. Use `process.env` in your local development to insert an API key, and on block submission we'll work with you to see if it makes sense for Seam to apply for a global API key for the service you want to make a block for.
- I found a bug, and something is not working. How do I fix it?
    - The best way to file a bug is by using Github issues.
